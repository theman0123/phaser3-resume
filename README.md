NOTES:

using Piskel with Tiled:

BUILD GRAPHICS IN MULTIPLES OF 4 IN PISKEL EDITOR

export from Piskel at 1 x 1 ratio (32px x 32px) (whole graphic)

export at 128 or greater for buildings 

import in Tiled at 16 x 16 to split Piskel import into two tiles (assuming 32px).

import at 8x8 to split into 16 tiles (assuming 32px)

build your object in piskel relating to these measurements or graphics will not match well.

build your map in tiled with 8x8 tiles?? is this common?
